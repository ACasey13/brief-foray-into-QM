    "**Background:** Analytical solutions for the wavefunction of a system cannot be obtained for any but the most simple systems such as the hydrogen atom and the infinitely deep potential well. If the ground state wavefunction is not known, a trial function $\\phi$ can be used in its place. According to the variational principle, $\\psi_0$ represents a lower bound on energy $E_0$ and any trial function $\\phi$ will result in an energy of at least $E_0$. Therefore, the trial function that results in the lowest possible energy could serve as an approximation for $\\psi_0$.\n",

While this is true, the infinitely deep potential well is still a relatively simple problem, and in practice, the higher energy eigenvalues will not satisfactorily approximate the higher energy levels. That is, the variational principle really only guarantees that the ground state energy will be accurately approximated (to the degree that the primitive functions can describe the wavefunction). Note that other methods exist to accurately approximate the upper bound on the energy."
